This template is designed for quickly starting a project for the AVR Dx series micro controllers on Linux with VS Code.

You will need AVRDx device packs from [microchip:](http://packs.download.atmel.com/)

Also you will need to update the paths in the makefile and c_cpp_properties files to point to where the device packs are installed on your system.
